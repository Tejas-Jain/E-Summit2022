SUMMARY:Cyber Security Summit NYC USA
DESCRIPTION:Background tothis event\n	\n\n	Structure ofthe event\n	\n	We are friends with the folks at these events and we can personally vouch for them! “Cyber Summits” are events that take place in 9 cities around the USA and not just New York. \nThis one in Manhattan is the largest and most prestigious of the nine conferences; “The Cyber Security Summit”which is an exclusive C-Suite conference series that has the objective of connecting senior level executives responsible for protecting their companies’ critical infrastructures. \nThis is a rather high-brow event takes place consistently during UN Week making it the “local Summit” for the producers as it attracts delegates from around the world. It’s filled with innovative solutions to contemporary threats and is certainly worth attending if you are a senior IT manager and/ or company director. \n	Each of these official Cyber Security Summits is always Keynoted by some of the highest ranking experts from The Dept. of Justice\, The FBI\, The NSA and or The US Secret Service to share the latest threat landscape to each city’s of business leaders. The main ‘thrust’ of this one day only conference\, or as they label it\, ‘summit’\, is to focus on educating attendees on how to best protect highly vulnerable business applications with interactive panel discussions and roundtables led by subject matter experts from both government and commercial sectors. This is an event certainly worth attending if you live on the East Coast (New York\, Boston etc) and are responsible for your organization’s enterprise cybersecurity. Each attending executive is treated to a catered breakfast\, lunch & cocktail reception which includes complimentary fine cigars! The video below is something their marketing team put together.
