SUMMARY:New York Metro Joint Cyber Security Conference
DESCRIPTION:Background tothis event\n	\n\n	Structure ofthe event\n	\n	Next on our list is the “New York Metro Joint Cyber Security Conference” which is actually a collaboration of leading information security industry organizations and chapters within the NYC region. We included this event because\, if you work in cyber security\, then this is a neat little event in which you can network and get to know ‘real’ industry professionals. Cyber Security groups in attendance will be: InfraGard (New York Metro)\, ISACA (New York Metro\, New Jersey and Greater Hartford Connecticut)\, ISC2 New Jersey\, ISSA (New York)\, OWASP (New York Metro\, Long Island\, Brooklyn)\, HTCIA (North East Region) and ACFE (New Jersey). \n	With such an awesome array of professionals under one roof this event had to make our list. If you want to network within information security then this is one event in NYC that you must not miss. \nAlthough the video below is a little old it is still a good example of what you can expect at this event. \n	Deadline and start date: \nApplication deadline and start date were not specified by the programme. \n	Programme intensity: \nYou can choose to do this programme part-time or full-time. \n	Delivery mode: \nOn Campus
