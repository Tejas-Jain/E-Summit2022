A conference table with seats on swings? Floors completely cleared of all walls and barriers?<\/p>\n<p>Old George G. Booth\u2019s head must be spinning.<\/p>\n<p>News Publisher Booth hired his friend Albert Kahn in 1916 to design the blocklong building, which the newspaper occupied until several years ago when the landmark was sold to Bedrock.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, The News and the Detroit Free Press, which moved into the bottom floors in 1998, relocated to Minoru Yamasaki\u2019s elegant, modernist annex attached to the 1927 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago building a block off Campus Martius.<\/p>\n<p>The first shock to anyone who worked in The News building is the impressive, historically accurate restoration of the lobby. Drop-ceilings that obscured its beauty for decades have been ripped out to reveal arched ceilings that give the space unexpected airiness and height.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor the lobby lamps,\u201d said dPop Lead Designer Kristin Kostrzewski, \u201cwe used reproductions and creatively adapted fixtures. So the original glass globe lamp,\u201d the chandelier that once hung at the entrance with its colored map of the world, \u201cis now a hand-hammered metal globe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(The original chandelier disappeared in some ill-advised renovation years ago. The lobby, by the way, is accessible to the public. By all means, step inside and take a gander if you\u2019re walking past 615 W. Lafayette. It\u2019s worth the detour.)<\/p>\n<p>Snappy furniture greets you as you walk in the main entrance, while Detroit artist Leon Dickey\u2019s \u201cLove Letters,\u201d a large wall sculpture that looks a bit like randomly rolled sheets of blank newsprint, dominates the lobby\u2019s east wall.<\/p>\n<p>Upstairs on the third floor, old News editors and reporters will find the former newsroom utterly transformed, though the wood paneling that covered part of it has been mostly preserved.<\/p>\n<p>Utterly unlike anything ever seen in the old newsroom is the Swing Table designed by Duffy London, a British firm that creates amusing, esoteric furniture.<\/p>\n<p>Much like a swing set, the five seats on either side of the large conference table hang from an overhead bar and, well, swing like mad. (The table, happily, is stationary.)<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"fl-col-group fl-node-58b36f0c2a61d fl-col-group-nested fl-col-group-custom-width\" data-node=\"58b36f0c2a61d\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"fl-col fl-node-58b36f0c2a682 fl-col-small\" data-node=\"58b36f0c2a682\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-col-content fl-node-content\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module fl-module-vamtam-heading fl-node-58b36f0c2a717\" data-node=\"58b36f0c2a717\" data-progressive-animation=\"move-from-left\" data-vamtam-animation-options=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;progressive&quot;,&quot;origin&quot;:&quot;center center&quot;,&quot;exit&quot;:false,&quot;delay&quot;:0,&quot;mobile&quot;:false,&quot;pin&quot;:false,&quot;pinTrigger&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module-content fl-node-content\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"vamtam-heading \">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"vamtam-heading-line vamtam-heading-line-left\"><\/span>\n\t\n\t\n\t<span class=\"vamtam-heading-text\">This table has been a big hit<\/span>\n\n\t\n\t\t\t<span class=\"vamtam-heading-line vamtam-heading-line-right\"><\/span>\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"fl-module fl-module-vamtam-heading fl-node-58b36f0c2a830\" data-node=\"58b36f0c2a830\" data-progressive-animation=\"fade\" data-vamtam-animation-options=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;progressive&quot;,&quot;origin&quot;:&quot;center center&quot;,&quot;exit&quot;:false,&quot;delay&quot;:0,&quot;mobile&quot;:true,&quot;pin&quot;:false,&quot;pinTrigger&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module-content fl-node-content\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"vamtam-heading \">\n\t\n\t\n\t<span class=\"vamtam-heading-text\">@BuildingConstruction<\/span>\n\n\t\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"fl-col fl-node-58b36f0c2a6d0\" data-node=\"58b36f0c2a6d0\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-col-content fl-node-content\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module fl-module-rich-text fl-node-58b36f0c2a75e\" data-node=\"58b36f0c2a75e\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module-content fl-node-content\">\n\t\t<div class=\"fl-rich-text\">\n\t<p class=\"p-text\">said Fehan.

And people are here from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Many of the design touches throughout were created by local artisans.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the large, snazzy-looking black banquettes on several floors \u2014 including one huge one that incorporates red metal into the design \u2014 were created by Virtuoso Design + Build on Detroit\u2019s east side.<\/p>\n<p>The banquettes, like the Swing Table, are reportedly popular. Trainee bankers study on them, according to Robert McDonald, Quicken Loans facilities site leader, and on occasion, when necessary, catch a nap.<\/p>\n<p>A large conference table with a historic picture of old newspaper carriers printed right on the wood was created by Detroit furniture designer Brian DuBois.<\/p>\n<p>All signage, like on conference rooms named for other U.S. newspapers around in 1916, was crafted by Livonia\u2019s Jiffy Signs.<\/p>\n<p>The aim in the entire redesign,said Kostrzewski, \u201cwas to create a comfortable living room atmosphere\u201d for today\u2019s unstructured, adaptable workplaces.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to transform work spaces to create more collaborative and open environments that encourage productivity and encourage people to want to come to work,\u201d said Jennifer Janus, dPop chief operating officer.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since Bedrock Real Estate purchased The Detroit News building in 2014, the company has gutted the structure and created a modern workspace with custom-designed furniture by local craftsmen Who isn&#8217;t interested in seeing what the new owners do to your house after the sale?
